### Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 v1903 (18362) or newer.
- Our installer will install the following items:
   - [.NET Core 3.1.23 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.23-windows-x64-installer) or a newer 3.1.x runtime. This is needed currently for the Settings application.
   - [.NET 6.0.3 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.3-windows-x64-installer) or a newer 6.0.x runtime.

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

### Installer

- Dependencies installers are now executed with /norestart to avoid unprompted reboots. (This was a hotfix for 0.56). Thanks [@franky920920](https://github.com/franky920920)!
- Upgraded .NET framework dependency to 6.0.3.
- Installer logs are now saved where they can be collected and sent by the bug report tool.
